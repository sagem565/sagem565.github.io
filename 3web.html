Website Analysis.
	
            
            The three websites I chose to analyze are lululemon.com, juilianabicycles.com, and Spectrum Business’ website . LuluLemon and Juliana both are wonderfully designed, easy to navigate, and aesthetically impressive sites, while Spectrum Business’ website is atrociously horrible in most aspects.
	LuluLemon has an established aesthetic that is noticeable from the moment you open their homepage.  They have a deep rooted branding that extends from its storefronts, clothing, social media, etc… and is fully embraced through their site.  They have recognizable design elements, fonts, and photos that establish a consistency in their branding.  
	LuluLemon takes on a minimalistic design, warm toned images, and clean fonts that make visiting the site comfortable and easy.  If you have ever been inside a LuluLemon store, they have a similar aesthetic which they carry through.  
	The UI of the site is well thought out and easy to navigate.  Even though they have thousands of products, blog posts, etc… it feels as if you can find exactly what you are looking for in just a few clicks.  The simplicity of the UI is continued in their mobile optimization.  The mobile site almost has a social media feel, with a heavy emphasis on images and ease of navigation.  It’s an overall very simple website to use.
	Juliana Bike’s is similar to Lulu in the fact that they both are online stores with an emphasis on design and imagery.  However, Juliana has an additional challenge of showcasing a much more complicated product of bicycles.  Their bikes all have so many technical specifications differentiating each other, and it can often seem overwhelming on other bike manufacturers websites.  But Juliana does a great job with this challenging task.  This is due in large part to the way they show the photos of each bike and trim.  They have highly detailed images, and allow you to zoom in very tight without losing quality.  This gives a much easier way to have a detailed look at each bike and their features.  They also have detailed spec sheets of each of their bikes, and a very helpful comparison tool.
	These are two examples of well designed sites.  Spectrum Business, on the other hand, is horrible in almost every way.  To begin, the website looks as if it were designed in 1995 and was never updated.  It is almost entirely text, with what seems to be no effort at a clean, aesthetic design.  Given that this site is intended for business use only, it is fair that design is not a priority if the interface was easy to use.  Some sites will choose to sacrifice design in return for a simpler user interface.  That is not the case here.  The UI of this site is as bad as the design.  It is very difficult to navigate and pages are often buried behind so many other layers.  To do something as simple as changing a domain name, one of the primary functions of the site, you need to navigate through multiple pages, call the provider, and wait up to three weeks for it to take place.  Compare this to a site such as Google domains or Godaddy where you can do this instantly from the homepage with no wait, this is much worse.  On top of this, their mobile optimization is almost non-existent and essentially unusable.  There are many issues with scaling, navigation menus, and more.  Overall there are little to no redeeming qualities of this website.
