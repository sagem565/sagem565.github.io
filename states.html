<P>1. My personal favorite  website was Vermonts. The grey and white color scheme gave it a really clean look but What stood out the most to me was defiantly The photo grid at the top of the website. The picture grid that you could click on to view website content really set it apart from the other websites. The logo was clean and all the content links opened without any trouble.</P>
    <p>2. Tennessee had ah even more professional and finished look then Oklahoma, Iowa and Alaska. 
The font used is really what made it look better then Oklahoma as well as the blue and red framing around the photos. This website had a really finished look.  And all the content was easy to get a hold of.</p>
<p>3. Oklahoma was by far more professional looking then both Iowa and Alaska. The photos were extremely high quality. The logo at the top really grabbed your attention and the website wasn’t overwhelming with content right when you opened it. Pretty much all the information was held in one menu bar making it far less overwhelming. The actual content of the website was extremely vast. The photos for popular content on the page such as covid 19 information gave the website a lot of aesthetic.</p>

<p>4. Iowa’s website was far more clean in appearance. The website didn’t overwhelm with a massive amount of resources all at once. The menu  led you to clear information. I especially liked the welcome to Iowa section that just provided statistics for living in Iowa, I thought that really helped add interesting fun content to the home page. The overall them of blue and white colors was a clean choice. I do think the home page was a little long it seemed to go on forever but the content was interesting so that helped.</p>
        
<p> 5. Alaska was not well layed out.I was overwhelmed by how many diffrent buttons were on the website. when I clicked on some it did not pull up any information and just said page error. i thnink its safe to say that Alaska needs the most improvment.
