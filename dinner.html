        <p>With a quick Google search of "best places to eat in Helena", most sources will point you to On Broadway.  Well let me just say... they fooled me.  On Broadway was the worst dining experience I've had on this journey... Hot take, I know.  First off, our wait was well over an hour so we sat at the bar for drinks and appetizers.  The drinks were decent, but the bread was cold and barely a step up from Wonder Bread.  Once seated, our waitress was incredibly nice, no dig on the service.  However our entre was horrible.  My salad was drowned in neon pink "dressing" that more resembled pepto bismol than food.  And don't get me started on the radioactive looking pesto... I'll end my rant their, but in the end On Broadway is over hyped and I just can't support soggy pasta. </p>

        <p>Big 180 here.  Days after eating at On Broadway I tried Bella Roma.  This is Italian food as it is meant to be.  I was greated with a wonderful prosciutto platter and wine.  For the main course, rosemary chicken that made my knees weak... Maybe On Broadway set the bar really low, or Bella Roma really came through.  I look forward to my next visit. </p>

        <p>Remember when I said that Suki Cafe was tied as my favorite place to eat in Helena? Well this is the other tie.  You may be confused why a breakfast diner is in the dinner section.  Well that is because Shellies is a 24/7 experience.  The food is standard, but the service is unmatched.  While embarrassing to admit, I went to Shellies at 1am four nights in a row.  I had the same server, Shayna, every time.  Rather than judging me, as I would deserve, she remembered me, knew my order, and was far more enthusiastic than any other server would be at 1am on a tuesday.  Don't forget to try the lava cake.  It rips.</p>
