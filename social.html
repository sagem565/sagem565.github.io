        <p> A bit of background on me.  My name is Sage Lawrence, I am 21 years old and I am a communications major at Carroll College.  I am originally from Calgary, Alberta, but moved to Monteray, California in middle school.  Growing up, my familly would always drive through Montana and it sparked my love for this special place.  After high school and a short stint living in Florida, I found my way to Helena and it was the best decision I've made.  I spend most of my time skiing at Great Divide in the winter, and traveling for mountain bike races during the summer.
